.SH DESCRIPTION
.B abduco
provides a way to disconnect a given application from it's controlling
terminal thus it provides roughly the same session attach/detach support as
.BR screen(1) , " tmux(1)" " or" " dtach(1)".

By default all session related information is stored in 
.B $HOME/.abduco
or as a fallback in 
.BR /tmp/.abduco .
However if a given session name starts either with a dot or a forward slash
it is interpreted as a path name and used unmodified i.e. relatively to the
current working directory.
.SH OPTIONS
If no command line arguments are given all currently active sessions are
printed together with their respective creation date.
